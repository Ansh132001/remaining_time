Some useful plugins for anki.

If you find these plugins useful, feel free to donate via paypal.

## Automatic switch from Basic to Cloze = basic_to_cloze

This plugin prevents you from creating Cloze note in basic note types. If you try to do so, this plugin
just automatically changes the note type to Cloze. So you can make both cloze type and basic type notes
via Basic note type.

## Cloze (Hide all)

This addon creates a new card type. On this card type, all clozes except what you're reviewing now are hidden with
a yellow box.

## Word autocompleter

This adds sublime text-like fuzzy word autocompletion to anki.

## IME caret fixer = caretfix  (Experimental)

This is still an experimental addon. This hacky addon tries to fix a QtWebView's bug. That is, when you try to type
non-latin characters, carets (vertical bar indicating where you're typing) disappears.
